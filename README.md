# Audiocodes Syslog Viewer Tool

Licensed under the GPL v3

Audiocodes SBC devices create a lot of syslog information. They actually create so much it's not easy at all to find in there what you need. It's not possible to make settings to log only the things you need. It logs SIP OPTIONS by default which will put your log full of information you will never need when troubleshooting.

This tool has been created to be able to quickly browse through Audiocodes syslog information. You can search for calls in a webgui, the information of a call will be displayed in a SIP diagram and it's easy to skip through the call.

It's using an optimized rsyslog configuration that directly logs to a postgresql database, which uses triggers. With this configuration a lot of syslog data can be handled.

Here's a screenshot:

Since Audiocodes changes the layout of the Syslog data sometimes, the script may break on older/newer versions. It's currently been tested on 7.20A.204.108.

It needs some installation work. A script has been included that should do the hard work for you. This currently works fine on CentOS 7, it's untested for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS 6 but it should be close for those. These are the general steps done by this script:

- Install postgresql, php, rsyslog, webserver and git 
- Download the tool from Github
- Disable selinux
- Open firewall
- Let user postgres connect to the database from the terminal
- Copy the data to a directory

On a clean CentOS 7 system run the following. You will obviously end up with not the most secure setup since SELinux is disabled, improve if you desire more security...
Run this as root and make sure internet connection is available.
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niekvlessert/audiocodes_syslog_tool/master/bootstrap.sh
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
cd /opt/ast
```

After that you must use the maintanance script that can take care of several tasks:

- Create rsyslog configuration with postgres logging settings in /etc/rsyslog.d
- Initialise the database tables
- Generate a config.php in the webdirectory for the GUI
- Create the database tables for tomorrow
- Generate a cron file which takes care of the required tasks (generating the tables for tomorrow and delete old data to avoid disk space issues).

But before using it edit the settings.ini; then:

```
./ast_maintenance install
```

When done visit your webserver using Chrome/Firefox, the folder is /ast/.

Obviously you must set the Audiocodes device to log syslog data to the IP address of your Syslog machine. You can then try the GUI after some calls have been made through the device, or have a look in the database if it's not working:

```
psql -U syslog
select * from <devicename>_<month>_<day> order by id desc limit 10;
```

Be careful; every day for every SBC logging needs a few tables. If your system doesn't have them Rsyslog will fill the database log files very quickly. The cronjob in /etc/cron.d/cron_ast takes care of this. You may run ast_maintenance without command line options to see the command line options. Run with initializeDatabase to create the tables for today (and the required user and database if needed), use createDbTomorrow for the tables for tomorrow, you will need to run this before the end of the day obviously. Use deleteOldData to delete old data. Obviously this depends on some factors, but the disk fills up quicker then you'd think. When postgres runs out of space things look grim; it's difficult to retrieve any data. deleteOldData can have an argument, with that you can specify the amount of days in the past the data needs to be deleted from. CDR records will be preserved, it's the other bulk of logging that will be deleted.

## Updating

When updating your settings.ini will be preserved

```
cd ~/audiocodes_syslog_tool
git pull
php maintenance.php install
cd /opt/ast/
./ast_maintenance install
```

## Todo

- Search yesterday and before, only show the tables that have data
- Remove usual stuff only
- Sorting of the results seems off sometimes
- More information about calls after initial search
- Make the calls clickable only when there's call data available
- Sometimes the database trigger goes wrong, somehow the number of fields differs
- Display SBC errors/warnings detected in a nice searcheable way
- Add a bash completion file to be able to use tab to find correct paramaters of ast_maintenance
- Probably some (a lot?) of SIP scenarios will be parsed wrong, fix it whenever that occurs...
- The code is not very beautiful, split css/html/javascript more.
- Add some auth framework
